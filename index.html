        <p>This is a symbolic park named after the iconic legend <a href=""> Isaac Ayomide Adewuyi.</a> A lawyer per excellence and an advocate
            for the common man, <br>
            Today, the park service is a melting pot for all struggles emanating in the mega city (Lagos) In <i><strong>2010</strong></i>, a park in Ojota was named after him by the <strong>Lagos state government</strong>

        <p>I went to the park to take pictures for my photography assignment. I'm really proud such site of attraction was dedicated to Isaac Adewuyi. <br>
            He was a man of honor and justice.
        </p>
        <p>The park had beautiful sceneries thought it needs more security because of the Ojoto opportunists. It requires maintenance too. But overall I loved it</p>
